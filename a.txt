In twilight's soft glow, where love's tale begins,
A journey of unreal dreams that reality wins.
Her love, a beacon, a guiding light so clear,
I wished for forever, with her always near.

Through the labyrinth of doubts, she walks with grace,
A promise of love in every tender embrace.
A broken candle, she ignites with care,
Marrying dreams to reality, a love so rare.

In the tapestry of time, her devotion shines,
Two hearts entwined, where eternity twines.
Understanding my woes with a patient ear,
She turns problems to solutions, love sincere.

A melody of care, a song in every word,
Her actions, a symphony, emotions stirred.
In the Pacific shallows of her eyes,
A commitment deep, where true love lies.

An enigma of understanding, a refuge in strife,
She chooses solutions over the discord of life.
Through trials and tempests, her love unfolds,
A masterpiece of devotion, a story to be told.

In the realm of dreams, where wishes come alive,
Her love, a potion, forever to survive.
Unrealistic they deemed, but she made it true,
Marrying dreams to reality, forever with you.

In this eternal trance, where time takes flight,
I choose her, my love, every day and night.
With care, understanding, and devotion so real,
Our love, a timeless tale, forever to feel.
